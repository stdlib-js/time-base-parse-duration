    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# parseDuration

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Parse a duration string into an object.

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/time-base-parse-duration
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var parseDuration = require( '@stdlib/time-base-parse-duration' );
```

#### parseDuration

Parses a duration string into an object.

```javascript
var obj = parseDuration( '1m3s10ms' );
// returns { 'days': 0, 'hours': 0, 'minutes': 1, 'seconds': 3, 'milliseconds': 10 }

obj = parseDuration( '1m3s' );
// returns { 'days': 0, 'hours': 0, 'minutes': 1, 'seconds': 3, 'milliseconds': 0 }
```

The returned object has the following properties:

-   **days**: number of days.
-   **hours**: number of hours.
-   **minutes**: number of minutes.
-   **seconds**: number of seconds.
-   **milliseconds**: number of milliseconds.

## Notes

-   A duration string is a string containing a sequence of time units. A time unit is a nonnegative integer followed by a unit identifier. The following unit identifiers are supported:

    -   `d`: days
    -   `h`: hours
    -   `m`: minutes
    -   `s`: seconds
    -   `ms`: milliseconds

    For example, the string `1m3s10ms` is a duration string containing three time units: `1m` (1 minute), `3s` (3 seconds), and `10ms` (10 milliseconds). The string `60m` is a duration string containing a single time unit: `60m` (60 minutes).

-   Duration strings are case insensitive. For example, the string `1M3S10MS` is equivalent to `1m3s10ms`.

-   If a duration string does not contain a time unit, the respective property is set to `0`.

-   An empty string is considered a valid duration string and is parsed as `0d0h0m0s0ms`.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var parseDuration = require( '@stdlib/time-base-parse-duration' );

var obj = parseDuration( '1m3s10ms' );
// returns { 'days': 0, 'hours': 0, 'minutes': 1, 'seconds': 3, 'milliseconds': 10 }

obj = parseDuration( '60m' );
// returns { 'days': 0, 'hours': 0, 'minutes': 60, 'seconds': 0, 'milliseconds': 0 }

obj = parseDuration( '2d3h' );
// returns { 'days': 2, 'hours': 3, 'minutes': 0, 'seconds': 0, 'milliseconds': 0 }

obj = parseDuration( '1M3S' );
// returns { 'days': 0, 'hours': 0, 'minutes': 1, 'seconds': 3, 'milliseconds': 0 }

obj = parseDuration( '' );
// returns { 'days': 0, 'hours': 0, 'minutes': 0, 'seconds': 0, 'milliseconds': 0 }
